## Cooking Instructions

### Step 1: Prepare the Rice

1. Start by cooking your rice. You can use a rice cooker or a microwave to prepare it. Follow the instructions on your rice package or the specific device you're using.

### Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables

### Step 2: Sauté the Vegetables

2. In a large skillet or wok, heat 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat.

3. Add the diced onions and carrots to the pan. Sauté them for a few minutes until they start to soften and the onions become translucent.

4. Stir in the minced garlic and frozen peas. Continue to sauté for another 2-3 minutes until the peas are heated through.

### Step 3: Scramble the Eggs

5. Push the sautéed vegetables to one side of the pan to make room for the eggs.

7. Once the eggs are cooked, mix them in with the sautéed vegetables.

### Step 4: Add the Cooked Rice

8. Now, add the cooked rice to the skillet. Gently break up any clumps and stir to combine the rice with the vegetable and egg mixture.

9. Drizzle 2-3 tablespoons of soy sauce over the rice and mix well. You can adjust the amount of soy sauce to suit your taste. Season with salt and pepper as needed.
